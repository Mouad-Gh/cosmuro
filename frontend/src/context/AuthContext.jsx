    /*if we want to update this state object, we first of all call the dispatch function and inside the dipatch function 
        we would pass an object as an argument and this object should have a type property which normally 
        a string all caps(majuscule) that describes in words the state change that we want to make :
                        dispatch({type: 'CONNECT_WALLET'})
        the second properrty is a payload property which represents any data we need to make this change:
                        dispatch({type: 'CONNECT_WALLET', payload : data});(the argument inside it is known as an action)
     So when we call this dispatch function in turn our reducer function is invoke (walletAuthReducer) ant it passes the action into it
     so it can do its things and update the state using that information and data.
